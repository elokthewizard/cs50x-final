## Installation

Visit the project url (when it has been deployed) and use the app in your browser! No download/ installation necessary.

## Usage

### Getting started
To start exploring with ToneMap, click a root note on the keyboard. The program will automatically calculate the notes at the intervals that make up that note's major triad, and also display the formula used to make that chord. To see how another chord is built, there are buttons for many other useful chord shapes.

### Change inversion
A lot of piano chords can be played in one octave, but once you add enough tensions chord shapes can become quite dense. For this reason, ToneMap allows you to select which inversion you'd like to see the chord written with. Not familiar with the concept? Start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)). 

### Change page theme
ToneMap is meant to be a creative tool, so we've added the opportunity to personalize the page! Choose between lightmode, darkmode, and solarized color schemes!

Please note: ToneMap 1.0 only shows off chords across one octave, multiple octave functionality will be included in a future update.
