## Installation

Current versions of ToneMap run entirely on the web, but mobile versions for ios and android are planned for development in the future. The source code is available in the github repository, under the MIT license (or something i havent decided yet)

For a crash course on open source software please check out: 

## Usage

### Getting started
To start exploring with ToneMap, click a note on the keyboard. The program will automatically calculate the notes at the intervals that make up that note's major triad, and also display the formula used to make that chord. Selecting a chord first will default the rootnote to C, and build the shape you selected. 

### Change inversion
A lot of piano chords can be played in one octave, but once you add enough color, chord shapes can become quite dense. For this reason, ToneMap allows you to invert the spelling of the currently selected chord. Just hit the invert button and watch the magic happen! Chords will wrap infinitely across 2 octaves, effectively allowing reference to infinite inversions. In the event no chord or root has been selected, the program defaults to C Major. Not familiar with the concept? Start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(music)).
